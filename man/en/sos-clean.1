.TH SOS CLEAN 1 "Thu May 21 2020"
.SH NAME
sos clean - Obfuscate sensitive data from one or more sosreports
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sos clean TARGET [options]
    [\-\-domains]
    [\-\-map]
    [\-\-jobs]
    [\-\-no-update]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsos clean\fR or \fBsos mask\fR is an sos subcommand used to obfuscate sensitive information from
previously generated sosreports that is not covered by the standard plugin-based post
processing executed during report generation, for example IP addresses.
.LP
Data obfuscated via this utility is done so consistently, meaning for example an IP address of
192.168.1.1 in an unprocessed sosreport that gets obfuscated to, for example, 100.0.0.1, will be
changed to 100.0.0.1 in all occurrences found in the report.

Additionally, by default all such obfuscations are stored in "maps" that will be persistently
saved to /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping and be re-used on subsequent runs.
.LP
This utility may also be used in-line with \fBsos report\fR and \fB sos collect\fR by specifying the
\fB\-\-clean\fR or \fB\-\-mask\fR option.
.LP
When called directly via \fBsos clean\fR, the obfuscated archive is written as an additional file,
meaning the original unprocessed report still remains on the filesystem. When called via \fBreport\fR or
\fBcollect\fR, the changes are done in-line and thus only an obfuscated archive is written and available.
In either case, a mapping file containing the relationships between unprocessed and obfuscated elements will
be written in the same location as the resulting archive. This mapping file should be kept private
by system administrators.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.B TARGET
.TP
The path to the archive that is to be obfuscated. This may be an archive or an unbuilt sos temporary
directory. If an archive, it will first be extracted and then after obfuscation is complete re-compressed
using the same compression method as the original.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-domains DOMAINS
Provide a comma-delimited list of domain names to obfuscate, in addition to those
matching the hostname of the system that created the sosreport. Subdomains that
match a domain given via this option will also be obfuscated.

For example, if \fB\-\-domains redhat.com\fR is specified, then 'redhat.com' will
be obfuscated, as will 'www.redhat.com' and subdomains such as 'foo.redhat.com'.
.TP
.B \-\-keywords KEYWORDS
Provide a comma-delimited list of keywords to scrub in addition to the default parsers.

Keywords provided by this option will be obfuscated as "obfuscatedwordX" where X is an
integer based on the keyword's index in the parser. Note that keywords will be replaced as
both standalone words and in substring matches.
.TP
.B \-\-map FILE
Provide a location to a valid mapping file to use as a reference for existing obfuscation pairs.
If one is found, the contents are loaded before parsing is started. This allows consistency between
runs of this command for obfuscated pairs. By default, sos will write the generated private map file
to /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping so that consistency is maintained by default. Users may use this
option to reference a map file from a different run (perhaps one that was done on another system).

Default: /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping
.TP
.B \-\-jobs JOBS
The number of concurrent archives to process, if more than one. If this utility is called by
\fBsos collect\fR then the value of the jobs option for that utility will be used here.

Default: 4
.TP
.B \-\-no-update
Do not write the mapping file contents to /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping
